# MAV Markdown

This a Project that I started, to learn and practice webApp development.  
It uses the "MAV" tech-stack so:
- MongoDB as the database
- Actix-Web as the middleware/backend
- VanillaTS as the frontend (served by Node in this case)

To Build, type:
```sh
docker compose build --pull
```

To Run, type:
```sh
docker compose up -d
```
