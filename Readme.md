# MAV Markdown

This a Project that I started, to learn and practice webApp development.  
It uses the "MAV" tech-stack so:
- MongoDB as the database
- Actix-Web as the middleware/backend
- VanillaTS as the frontend (using Vite)

This is very much a learning by doing Project that im working on when i find the time
